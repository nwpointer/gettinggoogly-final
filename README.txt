to initialize static file server run the following command from the root directory:

'npm start'

this should start a server on port 8000 and requries python3 and http.server to be installed.

to run the included test suite run the command: 

'mocha'

if you do not have mocha installed (the js test framework I've used) run

'npm install -g mocha' to install mocha.
